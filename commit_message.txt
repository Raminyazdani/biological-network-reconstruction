Ramin Yazdani | MetaFlux | main | feat(metrics): Add F1-score and Matthews Correlation Coefficient

Enhanced accuracy assessment with F1-score and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)
for more comprehensive model evaluation.

Additional metrics:
- F1-Score: 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)
  Harmonic mean of precision and recall, provides balanced accuracy measure
  
- MCC: (TP*TN - FP*FN) / sqrt((TP+FP)(TP+FN)(TN+FP)(TN+FN))
  Balanced metric that accounts for all confusion matrix elements
  Particularly useful when class distribution is imbalanced

These metrics provide complementary views of model accuracy. F1-score balances
precision and recall, while MCC gives a single correlation coefficient between
predictions and observations.

Results exported to comprehensive accuracy comparison tables.

Verified: F1 and MCC calculations validated against known correct values.
