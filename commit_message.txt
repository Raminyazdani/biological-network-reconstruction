Ramin Yazdani | MetaFlux | main | feat(structure): Set up project structure with src/ directory and .gitignore

Created professional src/ directory structure for organizing source code, data, and models.
Added comprehensive .gitignore to exclude Python artifacts and cached data.

Directory structure:
- src/data/ for reference datasets
- src/models/ for SBML model files
- src/results/ for analysis outputs

.gitignore configured to exclude:
- Python bytecode (__pycache__, *.pyc)
- Jupyter checkpoints (.ipynb_checkpoints)
- Pickled model cache (pickled/, *.pkl)
- Temporary files

Verified: Directory structure is professional and follows Python best practices.
