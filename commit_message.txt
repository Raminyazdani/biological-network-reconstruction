Ramin Yazdani | MetaFlux | main | WIP(models): Add multi-model loading capability (path error)

Extended notebook to load multiple E. coli models for comparative analysis.
Implemented model iteration logic to process batch of models.

Bug introduced: Used incorrect relative path '../models/' for model directory.
This path assumes execution from a subdirectory, but the notebook runs from src/.
Models are not loading correctly due to incorrect path resolution.

Will fix in next commit after identifying the issue during testing.

Status: Models failing to load with FileNotFoundError.
