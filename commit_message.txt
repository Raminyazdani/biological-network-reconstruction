Ramin Yazdani | MetaFlux | main | feat(deps): Add requirements.txt with metabolic modeling stack

Added requirements.txt with essential Python packages for metabolic network analysis.
Core dependencies include:
- COBRApy for constraint-based metabolic modeling
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Jupyter for interactive analysis
- NetworkX and Matplotlib for visualization

All packages are standard PyPI packages with stable versions. This provides the
foundation for implementing flux balance analysis and gene essentiality predictions.

Verified: All listed dependencies are available and compatible.
