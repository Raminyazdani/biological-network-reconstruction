Ramin Yazdani | MetaFlux | main | feat(models): Fix model directory path in notebook

Fixed model loading paths from '../models/' to 'models/' to work correctly
when notebook is executed from src/ directory.

Root cause: The relative path '../models/' assumed notebook execution from a
nested directory, but actual execution context is src/, requiring 'models/'
as the correct relative path.

Fix tested with 2-3 models to confirm proper path resolution. All models now
load successfully from src/models/ directory.

Verified: Model loading works correctly from src/ execution context.
