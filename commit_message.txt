Ramin Yazdani | MetaFlux | main | feat(init): Initial commit - Create repository with basic README

Created repository with minimal structure focusing on metabolic network analysis.
Added initial README with project concept and overview.

This commit establishes the foundation for the MetaFlux project, which will analyze
E. coli genome-scale metabolic models using constraint-based modeling to predict
gene essentiality and validate against experimental datasets.

Verified: Basic repository structure is in place with descriptive README.
