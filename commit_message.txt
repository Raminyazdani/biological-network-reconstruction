Ramin Yazdani | MetaFlux | main | feat(comparison): Add comparison functions between predictions and experimental data

Implemented comprehensive comparison logic to align in-silico gene knockout
predictions with experimental essentiality datasets.

Key features:
- Data processing pipeline for multiple reference dataset formats
- Gene ID matching and normalization across different naming conventions
- Prediction vs experimental data alignment using common gene identifiers
- Data validation and cleaning to handle missing or ambiguous entries
- Structured comparison tables for downstream analysis

The comparison framework handles differences in gene nomenclature between
computational models (locus tags, gene names) and experimental datasets,
ensuring accurate matching for validation metrics.

Verified: Comparison logic correctly aligns predictions with experimental data.
