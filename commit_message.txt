Ramin Yazdani | MetaFlux | main | feat(models): Download initial E. coli genome-scale models

Downloaded first set of E. coli metabolic models from BiGG database for analysis.
Models added: e_coli_core, iJO1366, iAF1260.

Each model represents a different E. coli genome-scale metabolic reconstruction
with varying levels of detail and coverage. These will serve as the initial
test set for gene essentiality prediction accuracy.

Model formats verified as valid SBML XML. All models successfully load and
pass basic FBA optimization tests.

Verified: All three models load correctly and produce valid FBA solutions.
