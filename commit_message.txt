Ramin Yazdani | MetaFlux | main | feat(analysis): Create initial metabolic analysis notebook with FBA basics

Implemented initial version of analysis notebook with basic flux balance analysis.
Created framework for loading E. coli metabolic models from BiGG database and
performing gene knockout simulations.

Key features:
- Model loading functions using COBRApy
- Basic FBA optimization to predict growth rates
- Simple gene knockout simulation framework
- Tested successfully with iJO1366 model

This establishes the core analysis pipeline that will be expanded to handle
multiple models and comparison with experimental data.

Verified: Notebook successfully loads models and performs basic FBA calculations.
