Ramin Yazdani | MetaFlux | main | WIP(data): Integrate experimental gene essentiality datasets (missing imports)

Added reference datasets from published gene essentiality studies to enable
model validation. Implemented data loading for Excel (.xlsx, .xls) and ODS formats.

Datasets added:
- MSB-14-e7573-s004.xlsx (Joyce et al. study)
- msb4100050-s5.xls (Baba et al. Keio collection)
- pone.0236890.s001.ods (LB medium composition)
- essentialgenes_list.xlsx (Essential genes reference)

Bug introduced: Code uses pd.read_excel() but missing explicit imports for
openpyxl and xlrd libraries. Works if packages are globally imported but
violates best practice of explicit dependency declaration.

Will add missing imports in next commit.

Status: Data loading code present but missing explicit import statements.
