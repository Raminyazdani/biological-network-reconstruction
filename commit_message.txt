Ramin Yazdani | MetaFlux | main | feat(metrics): Implement precision and recall accuracy metrics

Added calculation of precision and recall metrics for gene essentiality predictions.
These metrics quantify how well each metabolic model predicts essential genes
compared to experimental knockout data.

Metrics implemented:
- Precision: true positives / (true positives + false positives)
  Measures proportion of predicted essential genes that are truly essential
  
- Recall: true positives / (true positives + false negatives)
  Measures proportion of truly essential genes correctly predicted

Calculations performed per-gene and per-model to enable both detailed analysis
and model-level comparisons. Results exported to initial CSV outputs.

Verified: Precision and recall calculations match expected values for test cases.
