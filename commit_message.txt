Ramin Yazdani | MetaFlux | main | feat(results): Complete analysis - Generate results CSVs and visualizations

Ran complete gene essentiality analysis across all 60+ E. coli metabolic models
and generated comprehensive results and visualizations.

Outputs generated:
- gene_accuracy_results_per_reference_and_metrics.csv
  Per-gene accuracy across all models and reference datasets
  
- model_accuracy_results_per_reference_and_metrics.csv  
  Per-model performance rankings with all accuracy metrics
  
- gene_knockout_comparison.csv
  Detailed knockout simulation results for each gene and model
  
- output.png
  Comparative visualizations (charts, heatmaps)

Analysis reveals significant variation in model accuracy, with some models
achieving >85% F1-score while others show lower predictive power. Results
documented in notebook markdown cells with interpretation.

Verified: All CSV files contain expected data structure and complete results.
